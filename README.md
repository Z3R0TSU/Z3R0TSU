**MS Data Science, Stony Brook University**  
MLE / Data Engineer · New York

---

MS grad with hands-on experience building LLM pipelines and 
distributed ML systems in research and production settings.

My work sits at the intersection of NLP and data engineering: 
fine-tuning language models, designing evaluation frameworks, 
and building the infrastructure that makes them reliable at scale.
Actively looking for MLE and DE roles.
